Custom Instructions in ChatGPT allow you to provide additional context and even format the type of response you want from the system every time you interact with it. In the OpenAI Chat Completions API you can access the same functionality using the System and Assistant messages. In this short course, learn how to take advantage of these features to get more consistent and customizable responses from both systems.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
